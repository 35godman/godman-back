Version: 3.5
Accept user input
This example accepts and logs user input:
import { KeyValueStore } from 'crawlee';
import
 
{
 
KeyValueStore
 
}
 
from
 
'crawlee'
;



const input = await KeyValueStore.getInput();

const
 input 
=
 
await
 
KeyValueStore
.
getInput
(
)
;

console.log(input);

console
.
log
(
input
)
;


To provide the actor with input, create a INPUT.json file inside the "default" key-value store:
{PROJECT_FOLDER}/storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json
{
PROJECT_FOLDER
}
/storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json


Anything in this file will be available to the actor when it runs.
To learn about other ways to provide an actor with input, refer to the Apify Platform Documentation.
