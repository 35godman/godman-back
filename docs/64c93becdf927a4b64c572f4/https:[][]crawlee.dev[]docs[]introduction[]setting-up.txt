Creating a new project​
​
The fastest and best way to create new projects with Crawlee is to use the Crawlee CLI. You can use the npx utility to download and run the CLI - it is embedded in the crawlee package:
Crawlee CLI
npx crawlee create my-crawler
npx crawlee create my-crawler


A prompt will be shown, asking you to choose a template. Crawlee is written in TypeScript so if you're familiar with it, choosing a TypeScript template will give you better code completion and static type checking, but feel free to use JavaScript as well. Functionally they're identical.
Let's choose the first template called Getting started example. The command will create a new directory in your current working directory, called my-crawler, add a package.json to this folder and install all the necessary dependencies. It will also add example source code that you can immediately run.
Getting started example
my-crawler
package.json
Let's try that!
cd my-crawler
cd
 my-crawler
npm start

npm
 start


You will see log messages in the terminal as Crawlee boots up and starts scraping the Crawlee website.

You can always terminate the crawl with a keypress in the terminal:
CTRL+C

Running headful browsers​
​
Browsers controlled by Playwright run headless (without a visible window). You can switch to headful by uncommenting the headless: false option in the crawler's constructor. This is useful in the development phase when you want to see what's going on in the browser.
// Uncomment this option to see the browser window.
// Uncomment this option to see the browser window.

headless: false

:
 
false


When you run the example again, after a second a Chromium browser window will open. In the window, you'll see quickly changing pages as the crawler does its job.

For the sake of this show off, we've slowed down the crawler, but rest assured, it's blazing fast in real world usage.
