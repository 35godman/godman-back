Welcome to Todoist!
Whether you‚Äôre managing a project or planning an exercise routine, Todoist can help. Learn the basics to stay on top of work and life.
Start with a project
Todoist projects keep all your tasks organized so you can achieve your goals ‚Äî large and small.
To create a project, select the + icon next to Projects in the navigation menu. You can add your project‚Äôs name, pick a color, and choose to see it as a list or board.

Projects
You can create projects to:
Make a teaching plan

Quick tip
Try a project template
Add your first task
All projects begin with a single step, but don‚Äôt stop there! Add every task that comes to mind.
Just select Add task while in your new project. Write your task‚Äôs name. Then choose Add task.
Add task

The most achievable tasks tend to be:
Super specific and clear
Actionable
Less than an hour long
Stay on schedule
Life‚Äôs smoother if you know when what needs to happen. Todoist can auto-detect due dates, nearly any way you write them!
When you‚Äôre typing your task‚Äôs name, write out your task‚Äôs due date, too.
Todoist understands things like:
Buy grapes today

today
Paint the deck this weekend

this weekend
Edit marketing report Sept 15 at 2pm

Sept 15 at 2pm
Attend professional development class every 3rd Tues for 6 months starting in April

every 3rd Tues for 6 months starting in April
Quick tip

Split big tasks into sub-tasks
Small tasks are far easier to complete than big ones, so break large goals into manageable to-dos.
Create a sub-task by selecting any task and choosing Add sub-task. Type your sub-task‚Äôs name and due date, as usual.
Add sub-task
Back in your project, you can use the arrow next to your main task to view or hide your sub-tasks.
arrow
Helpful hints:
Divide tough tasks into short, easy ones
Track all of your progress
Collapse for calm, expand to complete
Organize tasks into sections
Tidy up your long task lists with sections. You can neatly divide your project any way that works for you.
It‚Äôs easy! Hover below your list of tasks and select the Add section¬†line that appears.
Add section¬†
Quick tip
Tips and tricks:
Complete projects in stages
Try sections like To Do, Doing, Done

To Do, Doing, Done
Set a schedule by day, week, lunar cycle, whatever!
Find section inspiration
Get things out of your head
Not sure which project a new task should go in? Add the task to your Inbox ‚Äî the home for tasks without projects (yet).
Inbox
Find your Inbox at the top of the navigation menu. Any task that isn‚Äôt added to a specific project is added there by default.
Easily move tasks from your Inbox to projects later by selecting the task you‚Äôd like to move. In task view, use the project icon to choose the right project.
project icon
Plan your future
Find every task due today, this week, or any week in your Today and Upcoming¬†views.
Today
Upcoming¬†
You‚Äôll find both views below your Inbox in the navigation menu.

Today view shows you all the tasks due today in all of your projects.
Today

Upcoming view lets you see every task due in the future.
Upcoming
Prioritize your day
It‚Äôs easy to get lost in your task list when there‚Äôs a lot on your plate. Keep your focus with color-coded priority levels.
To use priority levels, select a task. From your task view, use the flag icon to choose red priority 1, orange priority 2, blue priority 3, or white priority 4.
flag icon
Your highest priority tasks will appear near the top of your Today and Upcoming views. That way, you know what to work on first.
Pro tips:
Pick only a few must-do tasks each day
Do your hardest task first
Reschedule any tasks you don‚Äôt check off
Celebrate your accomplishments
Small steps add up to big achievements over time. So take a moment to look back on all the progress you‚Äôve made.
Check things off your list by ticking the circle next to the task you have completed. Don‚Äôt worry, you can uncomplete tasks, too.
circle
uncomplete tasks
You can see every task you‚Äôve checked off by using the three dots icon at the top of your project. Choose Show completed tasks in the menu.

Reward yourself for a job well done!
