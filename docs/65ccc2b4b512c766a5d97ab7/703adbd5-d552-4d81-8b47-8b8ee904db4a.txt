PINECONE MEETUP SEATTLE: TAKING AI APPS TO PRODUCTION

Dec 12, 20236:00 PM - 9:00 PM PST
Pulumi, 1525 4th Ave #800, Seattle, WA

Taking AI applications from experiment to large-scale production can be
complicated. At this meetup we’ll walk you through a reference architecture that
makes it easy, complete with a vector database (Pinecone), data processing, data
sync, security features, and everything else you’ll need. And since it’s
orchestrated with Pulumi, you’ll be able to fork and run this in your own AWS
environment even before the reception starts!


We'll have food, drinks, and like-minded folks you can talk to about the
roadblocks and solutions you've found along the way.

 * 6:00pm: Doors open
 * 6:30pm: Talks
 * 7:30pm: Eat, drink, and chat!

 * Roie Schwaber-Cohen
