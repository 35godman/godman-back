UNDERSTANDING COLLECTIONS



A collection is a static copy of an index. It is a non-queryable representation
of a set of vectors and metadata. You can create a collection from an index, and
you can create a new index from a collection. This new index can differ from the
original source index: the new index can have a different number of pods, a
different pod type, or a different similarity metric.


> ℹ️
> 
> NOTE
> 
> Serverless and starter indexes do not support collections.


USE CASES FOR COLLECTIONS

Creating a collection from your index is useful when performing tasks like the
following:

 * Temporarily shutting down an index
 * Copying the data from one index into a different index;
 * Making a backup of your index
 * Experimenting with different index configurations

To learn about creating backups with collections, see .

To learn about creating indexes from collections, see .


PERFORMANCE

Collections operations perform differently with different pod types.

 * Creating a collection from an index takes approximately 10 minutes.
 * Creating a p1 or s1 index from a collection takes approximately 10 minutes.
 * Creating a p2 index from a collection can take several hours.


LIMITATIONS

You cannot query or write to a collection after its creation. For this reason, a
collection only incurs storage costs.

You can only perform operations on collections in the current Pinecone project.
