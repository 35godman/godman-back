ORIGIN STORY

Pinecone was founded in 2019 by Edo Liberty. As a research director at AWS and
at Yahoo! before that, Edo saw the tremendous power of combining AI models and
vector search to dramatically improve applications such as spam detectors and
recommendation systems.

While he was working on custom vector search systems at enormous scales, he
assumed there was already a packaged solution out there for everyone else who
didn’t have the same engineering and data-science resources available. To his
surprise, there wasn’t. Thus Pinecone and the category of solutions was born.

Pinecone was created to provide the critical storage and retrieval
infrastructure needed for building and running state-of-the-art AI applications.
The founding principle was to make the solution accessible to engineering teams
of all sizes and levels of AI expertise, which led to the fully managed service
and ease of use that Pinecone is known for today.
