AMAZON SAGEMAKER



Amazon SageMaker and Pinecone can be used together for high-performance,
scalable, and reliable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use-cases. The
integration allows us to use SageMaker compute and model hosting for Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Pinecone as the knowledge base that allows us to keep
our LLMs up to date with the latest information and reduce the likelihood of
hallucinations.

Stay tuned for more info.
