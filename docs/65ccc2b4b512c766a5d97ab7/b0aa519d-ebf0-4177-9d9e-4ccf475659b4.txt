LIMITS



This is a summary of current Pinecone limitations. For many of these, there is a
workaround or we're working on increasing the limits.


UPSERTS

Max vector dimensionality is 20,000.

Max size for an upsert request is 2MB. Recommended upsert limit is 100 vectors
per request.

Vectors may not be visible to queries immediately after upserting. You can check
if the vectors were indexed by looking at the total with describe_index_stats(),
although this method may not work if the index has multiple replicas. Pinecone
is eventually consistent.

Pinecone supports sparse vector values of sizes up to 1000 non-zero values.


QUERIES

Max value for top_k, the number of results to return, is 10,000. Max value for
top_k for queries with include_metadata=True or include_data=True is 1,000.


FETCH AND DELETE

Max vectors per fetch or delete request is 1,000.


NAMESPACES

There is no limit to the number of for p1, s1, or p2 indexes. Indexes in
gcp-starter are limited to 100 namespaces.


POD STORAGE CAPACITY

Each p1 pod has enough capacity for 1M vectors with 768 dimensions.

Each s1 pod has enough capacity for 5M vectors with 768 dimensions.


METADATA

Max metadata size per vector is 40 KB.

Null metadata values are not supported. Instead of setting a key to hold a null
value, we recommend you remove that key from the metadata payload.

Metadata with high cardinality, such as a unique value for every vector in a
large index, uses more memory than expected and can cause the pods to become
full.
