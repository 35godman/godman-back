MANAGING COST



This page provides guidance on managing the cost of Pinecone. For the latest
pricing details, see our . For help estimating total cost, see . To see a
calculation of your current usage and costs, see the in the Pinecone console.


CHOOSE THE RIGHT INDEX

 * Serverless: With serverless indexes, you don't configure or manage any
   compute or storage resources. Instead, based on a , serverless indexes scale
   automatically based on usage, and you pay only for the amount of data stored
   and operations performed, with no minimums. This means that there’s no extra
   cost for having additional indexes.

 * Pod-based: Pod sizes are designed for different applications, and some are
   more expensive than others. , so you pay for the resources you need. For
   example, the s1 pod type provides large storage capacity and lower overall
   costs with slightly higher query latencies than p1 pods. By switching to a
   different pod type, you may be able to reduce costs while still getting the
   performance your application needs.

> NOTE
> 
> Serverless indexes do not support collections at this time.

When a specific index is not in use, and delete the inactive index. When you're
ready to use these vectors again, you can . This new index can also use a
different index type or size. Because it's relatively cheap to store
collections, you can reduce costs by only running an index when it's in use.


USE NAMESPACES FOR MULTITENANCY

If your application requires you to separate users into groups, consider .
Depending on your application requirements, this may allow you to reduce the
total number of active indexes.
