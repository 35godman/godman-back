Gong selected Pinecone as the core database infrastructure for Gong's innovative
AI system, Smart Trackers. It plays a crucial role in storing and processing
vector embeddings, enabling efficient tracking and classification of concepts
within user conversations. Through Pinecone, Gong achieves efficient vector
searches, empowering Smart Trackers to offer users precise and relevant examples
for concept tracking in conversations.

is a revenue intelligence platform that transforms organizations by harnessing
customer interactions to increase business efficiency, improve decision-making,
and accelerate revenue growth. Gong's commitment to innovation led to developing
proprietary artificial intelligence technology to enable teams to capture,
understand, and act on all customer interactions in a single, integrated
platform.

In early 2020, Gong was a trailblazer in adopting a vector database for semantic
search. Spearheading this endeavor was Jacob Eckel, VP, R&D Division Manager,
who has played a pivotal role in Gong's journey from its early days. From being
the first Gong hire to now leading Gong's AI Platform R&D division, Jacob’s team
is dedicated to supporting Gong's platform through cutting-edge AI technology.

Challenge


REVOLUTIONIZING CONVERSATIONAL ANALYSIS WITH AI

To transform revenue intelligence, Gong relies on effectively processing and
analyzing the wealth of data collected from customer conversations. To perform a
comprehensive analysis for these conversations, it is necessary to track and
extract relevant concepts from sentences and capture the nuanced expressions in
order to provide valuable insights and actionable intelligence for users. Gong’s
market-leading insights and intelligence, based on billions of customer
interactions, enable organizations to develop high-performing revenue teams that
are more productive and effective through advanced coaching and deal execution.

Gong developed an innovative "active learning system" called , a patented
technology that leverages AI allowing it to detect and track complex concepts in
conversations. Smart Trackers leverages AI algorithms and to dynamically analyze
conversations. With Smart Trackers, Gong users contribute to the model creation
process without the need for technical proficiency and specialized skills for
algorithm building and data management. In this system:

 * Users provide examples of sentences that express a specific concept and
   classify them as relevant or not.
 * Each model represents a concept in the user conversation. For example, a
   sales manager wants to track when a competitor is mentioned during a sales
   call — now, the competitor becomes a concept.
 * The system retrieves many more examples from real conversations based on the
   user-provided examples.

Smart Trackers depend on real-world examples from conversations for continuous
learning and adaptation from users' feedback. "Users want to track different
concepts that occur in conversations, and simple keywords do not work,” shared
Jacob. Using traditional keyword-based methods wouldn't be effective with this
system because conversations are dynamic and rich with nuances, contextual
variations, and subtle expressions.

Because of keyword search limitations, Gong needed a capable of supporting the
tracking and classification of concepts without being computationally heavy,
delivering prompt results to users.

Solution


LEVERAGING PINECONE TO FINE-TUNE SMART TRACKERS

As Gong delved into the complex world of concept detection, Gong’s ML team
recognized the need for a vector database solution that would support searches
across a vast corpus of conversational data. While other options were available,
including open-source alternatives, Gong selected Pinecone as their vector
database partner to support the development of Smart Trackers.

The decision wasn't merely about addressing immediate needs; it was a
forward-looking move. Gong saw Pinecone as a partner with the capability to lead
in the market, aligning with their own aspirations for growth and technological
advancement. Early in Pinecone's development, Gong recognized the potential for
a lasting partnership that would go beyond a transactional vendor relationship.
“We decided to be both a customer and design partner of Pinecone," said Jacob.
The partnership with Pinecone not only provided the necessary infrastructure but
also a trusted ally that understood Gong's use case.

Pinecone serves as the core database infrastructure for Gong’s technology
underlying Smart Trackers, playing a crucial role in storing and processing
vector for tracking and classifying concepts within user conversations. At the
end of each user conversation, Gong processes each conversation and converts
them into sentences. Gong anonymizes the data by embedding each sentence in a
768-size vector, along with metadata. The resulting information is encrypted and
then stored in Pinecone. Using encryption and namespaces ensures a secure and
efficient storage mechanism for the vast array of conversations processed by
Gong.

Once sentences are embedded, Gong uses Pinecone for vector searches to identify
sentences similar to the provided examples. Here is how the workflow works:

 * Smart Trackers Processing: Smart Trackers process the search results,
   analyzing and classifying sentences based on their relevance to the tracked
   concept.
 * User Presentation: The processed results are then presented to the user. This
   step allows users to track and monitor the identified instances of the
   specified concept in conversations.
 * Accurate Labeling: Using a vectorized representation of the concept enables
   the system to efficiently capture the nuances and contextual variations
   present in user conversations, facilitating the accurate labeling of each
   concept.
 * Fine-tuning: Pinecone helps fine-tune the system by identifying specific
   concepts that can be applied to all conversations or subsets of conversations
   chosen by the user.

High level Diagram: Classification Use Case

By integrating Pinecone into this process, Gong achieves efficient vector
searches, enabling Gong’s Smart Trackers to provide users with precise and
relevant examples for concept tracking in user conversations.

As the partnership with Pinecone evolved, the requirements to support Gong's
needs also evolved. Gong already knew that Pinecone was the leading vector
database in the market and wanted to continue exploring an alternative to its
existing Pinecone architecture for enhanced efficiency. Even after comparing it
to other vendors, they trusted Pinecone to address their evolving requirements.
Gong's use case is one of the primary inspirations for the recently available ,
enabling Gong to seamlessly leverage vector storage at any scale while achieving
substantial cost reductions.
