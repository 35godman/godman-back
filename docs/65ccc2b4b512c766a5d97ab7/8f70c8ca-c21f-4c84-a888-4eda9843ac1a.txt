MONITORING



Pinecone generates time-series performance metrics for each Pinecone index. You
can monitor these metrics directly in the Pinecone Console, or you can pull them
into or Prometheus- and -compatible tools, such as .


MONITOR IN THE PINECONE CONSOLE

To view performance metrics in the Pinesone Console:

 1. Log in to the .
 2. Select the index that you want to monitor.
 3. Go to the Metrics tab.


MONITOR WITH PROMETHEUS


> ℹ️
> 
> NOTE
> 
> This feature is available only for pod-based indexes on Enterprise or
> Enterprise Dedicated plans. Serverless indexes do not currently support
> Prometheus monitoring.

Pinecone metrics are available at the following URL:

https://metrics.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.pinecone.io/metrics.

To monitor Pinecone with your own Prometheus instance, configure the
prometheus.yml file to target the Pinecone metrics URL, using your API key for
authorization:

YAML
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: pinecone-job-1
    authorization:
      credentials: <api-key-here>
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['metrics.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.pinecone.io/metrics']


Your API key must be passed via the Authorization header as a bearer token like
Authorization: Bearer \<api-key\>. Also, note that only the metrics for the
project associated with the API key will be ingested by Prometheus.

For more configuration details, see the .


EXAMPLE PROMETHEUS QUERIES

Return the average latency in seconds for all requests against the Pinecone
index example-index:

avg by (request_type) (pinecone_request_latency_seconds{index_name="example-index"})


Return the vector count for the Pinecone index example-index:

sum ((avg by (app) (pinecone_vector_count{index_name="example-index"})))


Return the total number of requests against the Pinecone index example-index
over one minute:

sum by (request_type)(increase(pinecone_request_count_total{index_name="example-index"}[60s]))


Return the total number of upsert requests against the Pinecone index
example-index over one minute:

sum by (request_type)(increase(pinecone_request_count_total{index_name="example-index", request_type="upsert"}[60s]))


Return the total errors returned by the Pinecone index example-index over one
minute:

sum by (request_type) (increase(pinecone_request_error_count{
      index_name="example-index"}[60s]))


Return the index fullness metric for the Pinecone index example-index:

round(max (pinecone_index_fullness{index_name="example-index"} * 100))



MONITOR WITH DATADOG


> ℹ️
> 
> NOTE
> 
> This feature is available only for pod-based indexes on Enterprise or
> Enterprise Dedicated plans. Serverless indexes do not currently support
> Datadog monitoring.

To monitor Pinecone with Datadog, use Pinecone's direct .

pinecone_request_error_count_total counter The number of data plane calls made
by clients that resulted in errors. - pid: Process identifier
- index_name: Name of the index
- project_name: Pinecone project name
- request_type: One of upsert, delete, fetch, query, describe_index_stats
pinecone_request_latency_seconds histogram The distribution of server-side
processing latency for pinecone data plane calls. - pid: Process identifier
- index_name: Name of the index
- project_name: Pinecone project name
- request_type: One of upsert, delete, fetch, query, describe_index_stats
pinecone_index_fullness gauge The fullness of the index on a scale of 0 to 1. -
