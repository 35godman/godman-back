DELETE VECTORS

post https://{index_host}/vectors/delete

The delete operation deletes vectors, by id, from a single namespace.

For guidance and examples, see .

Body Params
ids
array of strings

Vectors to delete.

ids
ADD string
deleteAll
boolean

This indicates that all vectors in the index namespace should be deleted.

truefalse
namespace
string

The namespace to delete vectors from, if applicable.


filter
object

If specified, the metadata filter here will be used to select the vectors to
delete. This is mutually exclusive with specifying IDs to delete in the ids
param or using delete_all=True. See .

Serverless indexes do not support delete by metadata. Instead, you can use the
list operation to fetch the vector IDs based on their common ID prefix and then
delete the records by ID.
