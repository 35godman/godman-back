Challenge


TRANSFORMING FACT FINDINGS FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS

Legal professionals need access to a comprehensive and diverse set of data to
build compelling cases or to respond effectively to legal inquiries. To
investigate facts related to litigation or investigation workflows, they need to
identify, collect, and analyze relevant information to support these cases.
However, legal datasets are inherently dynamic, with volumes fluctuating based
on case sizes and information complexities.

DISCO has developed an AI-powered platform designed to empower legal
professionals by offering immediate access to case facts, reducing manual tasks,
and amplifying their ability to deliver results. A standout feature within
Cecilia AI is Cecilia Q&A, a purpose-built AI fact expert facilitating seamless
natural language interactions. Users can query and analyze large datasets, in an
effort to streamline their workflow and enrich their overall experience.

Cecilia Q&A acts on the information stored in a customer's database to deliver
insights for legal professionals working with case-related data. During the
initial stages of legal discovery, legal experts grapple with substantial
volumes of unstructured data like documents, messages, emails, etc., that may
contain vital information for ongoing cases. At this crucial stage, Cecilia Q&A
is intended to provide a detailed and context-dependent view of the legal
content with the goal of providing a more advanced approach than conventional
keyword searches, for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.

Given the urgency for legal teams to swiftly interpret unfamiliar data, DISCO
needed a vector database for Cecilia Q&A that could adeptly navigate the
intricate complexities of legal information on an expanding scale. Crucially,
this vector database had to possess the dual capability of seamlessly ingesting
new data while retaining the capacity to address queries related to older
datasets.

Solution


SETTING THE FOUNDATION WITH PINECONE’S ARCHITECTURE

The DISCO team recognized the need for a vector database that would support
relevant searches across a massive volume of legal data. While other options
were available, DISCO selected Pinecone as their vector database partner to
support the development of Cecilia Q&A.

As users engage with Cecilia Q&A by posing natural language questions, Pinecone
helps facilitate the creation of to capture the semantic nuances of these
queries. The information obtained undergoes enrichment through DISCO's databases
for the purpose of creating a comprehensive knowledge base. Through the use of a
large language model, the system is designed to generate coherent and relevant
responses to complex legal inquiries. By leveraging Pinecone, DISCO sought to
achieve efficient vector searches, enabling real-time adaptability, query
performance for rapidly and accurately from vast legal datasets, from new and
old data.

To enhance efficiency, DISCO wanted to explore an alternative to pod-based
structure as it demanded a proactive approach to resource provisioning, often
resulting in over-provisioning to mitigate potential surges. Since legal cases
are inherently unpredictable, the team was looking for the flexibility to adapt
to varying data loads, only paying for the resources used, and eliminating the
need for complex pre-provisioning strategies. The team tested the recently
available , allowing them to eliminate the need for complex pre-provisioning
strategies, aligning with the scaling of infrastructure based on customer data
ingests.

TRANSITIONING TO PINECONE SERVERLESS IS PROJECTED TO REDUCE COSTS WHILE
MAINTAINING OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE

The decision to transition to Pinecone serverless was prompted by the challenge
of managing unanticipated customer ingests. In the pod architecture, the scaling
process resulted in doubling resources with each ingest, making it challenging
to predict and provision accurately. If a customer ingested a gigabyte of data,
it could lead to the creation of one pod. Subsequent data ingests, doubling the
volume, would require provisioning two pods, then four, and so on, creating cost
inefficiencies. The unpredictability of customer data ingests made it difficult
to pre-provision the exact number of pods needed.

With Pinecone serverless, DISCO expects to:

 * Reduce costs: The newly architected design of Pinecone serverless should
   empower DISCO to have the flexibility to adapt to varying legal data loads,
   only paying for the resources used.
 * Build at scale: With Pinecone serverless, DISCO should be able to scale the
   number of vectors as needed increasing the wealth of information extracted
   from legal documents.
 * Access easiest-to-use technology: The transition to a serverless architecture
   empowers DISCO to focus on building technology that should always remain
   up-to-date with the latest legal information without the burdens of
   provisioning, sharding, and rebuilding indexes.

> "The transition to Pinecone serverless was seamless. The APIs and contracts
> remained unchanged for our core interactions, simplifying baseline
> compatibility testing." - Rick Vestal, Director of Engineering, DISCO

SCALING UP FOR BROADER IMPACT

The strategic partnership with Pinecone has laid the foundation for future plans
for scalability and innovation. This ongoing partnership underscores DISCO's
commitment to staying at the forefront of legal technology, with plans to use
Pinecone as a key enabler for future advancements in their offerings.

Matt shares, “Our collaboration with Pinecone has been incredibly beneficial.
We've enjoyed direct access to their product team, receiving valuable insights,
well-documented guidance, and useful tips. The expertise of the Pinecone team
should play a pivotal role in steering us in the right direction, fostering a
strong and productive partnership."

> "Pinecone serverless opened up possibilities we hadn't considered before and
