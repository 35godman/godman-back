RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION

By James Briggs

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential component of the AI
stack. RAG helps us reduce hallucinations, fact-check, provide domain-specific
knowledge, and much more. Here, we will learn how to make the most of this
powerful technology.

INTRODUCTION

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the go-to method for sorting and
organizing information for Large Language Models (LLMs). RAG helps us reduce
hallucinations, fact-check, provide domain-specific knowledge, and much more.

When we start with LLMs and RAG, it is very easy to view the retrieval pipeline
as nothing more than plugging a vector database into our LLM — and this can be
enough for prototypes or simple use cases. However, there is a lot more we can
do with retrieval than this, we can create much more powerful and sophisticated
retrieval systems. Our LLMs require good input to produce good output, and
retrieval is an essential component of that.

In this ebook, we will learn how to build better RAG systems using advanced
techniques such as two-stage retrieval with reranking, hybrid search,
multi-query, and much more.
