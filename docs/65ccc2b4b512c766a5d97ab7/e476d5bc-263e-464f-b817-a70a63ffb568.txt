PINECONE MEETUP NYC: TAKING AI APPS TO PRODUCTION

Dec 14, 20236:00 PM - 9:00 PM EST
Brewer's Cellar at Torch and Crown Brewing, 12 Vandam St, New York, NY 10013

Taking AI applications from experiment to large-scale production can be
complicated.

At this meetup, you'll hear from Dave Melillo, adjunct instructor at Rutgers and
Product Director at FanDuel, about the real-world challenges of shifting from
legacy ML and deep learning approaches to GenAI: infrastructure needs, security,
scalability, and organizing the humans behind it.

Next, we will walk through a reference architecture complete with a vector
database (Pinecone), data processing, data sync, security features, and
everything else you’ll need to take a new project to production. And since it’s
orchestrated with Pulumi, you’ll be able to fork and run this in your own AWS
environment even before the reception starts!


We'll have food, drinks, and like-minded folks you can talk to about the
roadblocks and solutions you've found along the way.

 * 6:00pm: Doors open
 * 6:30pm: Talks
 * 7:30pm: Eat, drink, and chat!
