UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS



OVERVIEW

A Pinecone organization is a set of that use the same billing. Organizations
allow one or more users to control billing and project permissions for all of
the projects belonging to the organization. Each project belongs to an
organization.

For a guide to adding users to an organization, see .


PROJECTS IN AN ORGANIZATION

Each organization contains one or more projects that share the same organization
owners and billing settings. Each project belongs to exactly one organization.
If you need to move a project from one organization to another, contact .


BILLING SETTINGS

All of the projects in an organization share the same billing method and
settings. The billing settings for the organization are controlled by the
organization owners.


ORGANIZATION ROLES

There are two organization roles: organization owner and organization user.


ORGANIZATION OWNERS

Organization owners manage organization billing, users, and projects.
Organization owners are also for every project belonging to the organization.
This means that organization owners have all permissions to manage project
members, API keys, and quotas for these projects.


ORGANIZATION USERS

Unlike organization owners, organization users cannot edit billing settings or
invite new users to the organization. Organization users can create new
projects, and project owners can add organization members to a project. New
users have whatever role the organization owners and project owners grant them.
Project owners can add users to a project if those users belong to the same
organization as the project.

ORGANIZATION SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO)

SSO allows organizations to manage their teams' access to Pinecone through their
identity management solution. Once your integration is configured, you can
require that users from your domain sign in through SSO, and you can specify a
default role for teammates when they sign up. Only organizations in the
enterprise tier can set up SSO. To set up your SSO integration, contact Pinecone
support at .
