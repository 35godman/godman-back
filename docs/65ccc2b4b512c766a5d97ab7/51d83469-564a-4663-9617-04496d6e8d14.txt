ARCHITECTURE



This page describes the Pinecone architecture for . For architecture details
about serverless indexes, see .


BASIC ARCHITECTURE

The Pinecone vector database is a cloud-based service deployed partly on
Kubernetes. For pod-based architecture, Pinecone serves control plane requests
from an API gateway and routes these requests to user indexes; clients make data
plane requests directly to pods. See Fig. 1 below.

COMPONENTS

 * Pods. Each index has one or more replicas, each of which is deployed to a pod
   with assigned SSD and memory capacity. The CPU assigned to the pod performs
   computation; the SSD stores metadata.
 * A stream processor indexes vectors.
 * The blob store contains persistent snapshots of replica data.
