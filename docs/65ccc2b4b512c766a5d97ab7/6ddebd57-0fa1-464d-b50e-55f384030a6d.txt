PINECONE MEETUP SF: TAKING AI APPS TO PRODUCTION

Dec 5, 20236:00 PM - 8:45 PM PST
A16z offices, 180 Townsend St, San Francisco

Taking AI applications from experiment to large-scale production can be
complicated. At this meetup we’ll walk you through a reference architecture that
makes it easy, complete with a vector database (Pinecone), data processing, data
sync, security features, and everything else you’ll need. And since it’s
orchestrated with Pulumi, you’ll be able to fork and run this in your own AWS
environment even before the reception starts!

Next up, Jay Alammar, Director and Engineering Fellow (NLP) from Cohere, will
show you how to build Retrieval Augmented (RAG) applications with Pinecone and
Embed v3 (from Cohere)!

We'll have food, drinks, and like-minded folks you can talk to about the
roadblocks and solutions you've found along the way.

 * 6:00pm Doors open
 * 6:30pm-7:30pm Talks
 * 7:30 Eat, drink, and chat!
