ids of the most similar items in a namespace, along with their similarity
scores.

For guidance and examples, see .

Body Params
namespace
string

The namespace to query.


topK
int64
required

The number of results to return for each query.


filter
object

The filter to apply. You can use vector metadata to limit your search. See .

filter object
includeValues
boolean

Indicates whether vector values are included in the response.

truefalse
includeMetadata
boolean

Indicates whether metadata is included in the response as well as the ids.

truefalse
vector
array of floats

The query vector. This should be the same length as the dimension of the index
being queried. Each query() request can contain only one of the parameters id or
vector.

vector
ADD float
sparseVector
object

Vector sparse data. Represented as a list of indices and a list of corresponded
values, which must be with the same length.

sparseVector object
id
string

The unique ID of the vector to be used as a query vector. Each query() request
can contain only one of the parameters queries, vector, or id.


Show Deprecated

Responses
200

A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE.



Response body
object

The response for the query operation. These are the matches found for a
particular query vector. The matches are ordered from most similar to least
similar.

object
matches
array of objects

The matches for the vectors.

matches
object
id
string
required

This is the vector's unique id.


score
float

This is a measure of similarity between this vector and the query vector. The
higher the score, the more they are similar.


values
array of floats

This is the vector data, if it is requested.
