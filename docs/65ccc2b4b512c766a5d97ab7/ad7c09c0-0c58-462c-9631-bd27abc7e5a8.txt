SCALING AI APPLICATIONS WITH PINECONE AND KUBERNETES

By Roie Schwaber-Cohen

Scaling AI applications comes with it's own set of challenges - but it also
shares a lot in common with other kinds of production scale applications. In
this series, we'll explore these challenges and review a reference architecture
for a distributed AI application built to scale.

INTRODUCTION

Scaling AI applications comes with it's own set of challenges - but it also
shares a lot in common with other kinds of production scale applications. In
this series, we'll explore these challenges and review a reference architecture
for a distributed AI application built to scale. We'll apply a microservices
architecture with Kubernetes to demonstrate a concrete implementation to solve
these challenges.
