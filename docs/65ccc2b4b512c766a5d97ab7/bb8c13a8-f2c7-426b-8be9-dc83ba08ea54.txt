MOVING TO PRODUCTION



This page provides recommendations and best practices for preparing your
Pinecone indexes for production, anticipating production issues, and enabling
reliability and growth.

> 
> For high-scale use cases, consider using the [Pinecone AWS Reference
> Architecture]( as a starting point, and read up on .


PREPARE YOUR PROJECT STRUCTURE

One of the first steps towards building a production-ready Pinecone index is
configuring your project correctly.

 * Consider for your development and production indexes, to allow for testing
   changes to your index before deploying them to production.

 * Ensure that you have properly within your production environment, so that
   only those users who need to access the production index can do so.

 * Consider how best to manage the API key(s) associated with your production
   project.


TEST YOUR QUERY RESULTS

Before you move your index to production, make sure that your index is returning
accurate results in the context of
your application by for
evaluating your results.


LOAD TEST YOUR INDEXES

Before moving your project to production, consider determining whether your
index configuration can serve the load of queries you anticipate from your
application. You can write load tests in Python from scratch or using a load
testing framework like .


BACK UP YOUR INDEXES

In order to enable long-term retention, compliance archiving, and deployment of
new indexes, consider backing up your production indexes by .

> Serverless indexes do not support collections.


TUNE FOR PERFORMANCE

Before serving production workloads, identify ways to by making changes to your
deployment, project configuration, or client.


CONFIGURE MONITORING

ESTIMATE YOUR INDEX SIZE

Depending on your data and the types of workloads you intend to run, your
pod-based index may require a different and . Factors to consider include the
number of vectors, the dimensions per vector, the amount and cardinality of
metadata, and the acceptable queries per second (QPS). Use the to identify how
much of your current resources your indexes are using. You can with different
pod types and sizes to experiment.


PLAN FOR SCALING

Before going to production, consider planning ahead for how you might scale your
indexes when the need arises. Identify metrics that may indicate the need to
scale, such as and . Plan for increasing the number of pods, changing to a more
performant , the , increasing the number of , or increasing storage capacity
with a .


KNOW HOW TO GET SUPPORT

and availability SLAs you need. This may require you to upgrade to Enterprise.
