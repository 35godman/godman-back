PINECONE MEETUP SF: LEARN HYBRID SEARCH FOR RAG, MEET OUR FOUNDER

Oct 19, 202311:00 AM PDT

Come learn how the combination of sparse and dense vectors can noticeably
increase the relevance of your search results. We’ll do a deep dive building a
search engine for a knowledgebase chatbot combining hybrid search and RAG, and
take your questions along the way about how you can apply these techniques in
your own work.

Next, we will open the floor for our founder and CEO Edo Liberty to talk to us
more about the state of AI and what we are building at Pinecone. We are here to
support the amazing things our customers - like you- are doing.

 * 6:30pm Building a knowledgebase chatbot with hybrid search and RAG
