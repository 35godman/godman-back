GCP-STARTER ENVIRONMENT



OVERVIEW

This document describes concepts related to the gcp-starter environment. To
learn about indexes and other environments, see .


THE GCP-STARTER REGION IS A UNIQUE STARTER PLAN REGION

Users on the can choose to deploy their project on one of multiple . One option
is the gcp-starter region.

Unlike other Starter Plan regions, the gcp starter region has unique features
and limitations.


FEATURES

Like other Starter Plan environments, projects on the gcp-starter environment
support one pod with enough resources to support approximately 100,000 vectors.
Indexes on the gcp-starter environment do not specify pod types; calls ignore
the pod_type parameter.

Unlike other Starter Plan environments, projects in the gcp-starter region have
no retention limits; data is retained indefinitely. Indexes in these projects
are not deleted after inactivity as in other environments.

After upgrading from the Starter Plan, you keep your free gcp-starter project:
you are not charged for use on this project. To use your data on a Standard or
Enterprise environment, to a new project in a .


LIMITATIONS

Like other Starter Plan environments, projects in the gcp-starter environment do
not support replicas.

After upserting records to indexes in gcp-starter, the query and
describe_index_stats operations may not return updated records for up to 10
seconds.

The gcp-starter environment does not support the following features:

 * Collections
 * Delete by metadata
 * configure_index(). Because this environment only supports one index
   configuration, this operation is not supported.
 * describe_index() with metadata filtering
 * metadata_config parameter to create_index().


DEVELOPING ON GCP-STARTER

Because projects on the gcp-starter region do not support the above features,
you may need to use different features when developing your project.


NAMESPACES

Indexes in gcp-starter are limited to 100 . If you need more than 100
namespaces, you may wish to in your project. Another alternative is to upgrade
to the and use index types that support more namespaces.


COLLECTIONS

Projects in the gcp-starter environment do not support the feature. However,
collections may not be necessary or appropriate for projects in the gcp-starter
environment. Collections serve two primary purposes: decreasing usage by
archiving inactive indexes, and experimenting with different index
configurations. However, projects on the gcp-starter environment neither incur
usage costs nor specify pod types or sizes.


DELETE BY METADATA

Projects in the gcp-starter environment do not support . In some cases, you may
be able to instead. This may require you to first , then extract the record IDs.
