REVOLUTIONIZING REVENUE INTELLIGENCE: GONG'S STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH PINECONE

Through Pinecone, Gong achieves efficient vector searches, empowering Smart
Trackers to offer users precise and relevant examples for concept tracking in
conversations.

We wanted sub-second vector search across millions of alerts, an API interface
that abstracts away the complexity, and we didn’t want to have to worry about
database architecture or maintenance.

wouldn’t be possible without Pinecone.

FRONTIER MEDICINES AND PINECONE: PIONEERING THE USE OF SUPER LARGE VECTOR
DATABASES IN HEALTHCARE

Frontier Medicines utilizes Pinecone to supercharge their usage of vector
embeddings— specifically impactful for similarity searches over billions of
vectorized molecules.

Pinecone made it fast and easy to take vector search from research to
production, without DevOps. Thanks to their performance and scalability we can
provide accurate, reliable, and real-time threat detection to our customers.
