INTRODUCTION

Vector search has been big tech’s tightly kept secret for years. When you
perform a Google search, get recommended shows on Netflix, or find Amazon
suggesting that product you never knew you wanted, that isn’t magic; it’s vector
search.

It is ubiquitous in our daily lives, and every day new use cases appear, but now
it’s not only big tech’s secret sauce. From startups to blue-chip corporations,
vector search is finding success everywhere. Here, we will take the lid off the
jar and reveal where vector search is used.

In the following chapters, you will learn how vector search can enhance existing
applications and open doors to previously inaccessible opportunities.
