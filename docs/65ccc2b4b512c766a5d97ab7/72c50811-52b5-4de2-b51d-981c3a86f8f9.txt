You can now easily view and monitor usage and performance for your AI
applications in a single place with Datadog’s .

With Datadog’s monitoring and security platform, you can now meet your team’s
observability requirements and gain confidence when deploying large scale,
mission critical AI applications to production. The integration also enables you
to:

 * Optimize performance and control usage: Observe and track specific actions
   (e.g. request count) within Pinecone to identify application requests with
   high latency or usage. Monitor trends and gain actionable insights to improve
   resource utilization and reduce spend.
 * Automatically alert on metrics: Get alerted when index fullness reaches a
   certain threshold. You can also create your own customized monitors to alert
   on specific metrics and thresholds.
 * Locate and triage unexpected spikes in usage or latency: Quickly visualize
   anomalies in usage or latency in Pinecone’s Datadog dashboard. View metrics
   over time to better understand trends and determine the severity of a spike.

Datadog’s out-of-the-box dashboards and recommended monitors will also help you
quickly view your metrics and avoid rate-limit errors or excessive latencies.
For example, the index fullness monitor will automatically have a threshold of
=>80%, alerting you to scale up your index to prevent performance degradation.
