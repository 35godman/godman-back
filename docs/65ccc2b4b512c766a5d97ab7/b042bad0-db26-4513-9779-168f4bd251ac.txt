INTRODUCTION

Image retrieval has a long history, from term-matching manually annotated images
in the 70s to today’s state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches.

In this ebook, we will cover the state-of-the-art methods for image retrieval.
We will start with a brief history of the field before diving in to the pillars
of image retrieval: similarity search, content-based image retrieval, and
multi-modal retrieval.

Image retrieval relies on two components; image embeddings, and vector search.
We will cover how to produce information rich image embeddings with
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural
networks and transformers. Following this, we will learn how to pair our image
embeddings with vector search to build powerful image retrieval systems.

This ebook is for anyone who wants to build amazing image-search applications
using the latest methods in deep learning and information retrieval. No prior
knowledge in either is necessary!
