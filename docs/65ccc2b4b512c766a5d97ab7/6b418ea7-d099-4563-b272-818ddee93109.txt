HOW PRICING WORKS

Usage is measured in three metrics: storage, read units (RU), and write units
(WU). You pay only for what you use, no minimums or paying for idle resources.


STORAGE

The total size of your serverless indexes, measured in GBs. The size of an index
is defined as the total size of its recordsThe size of a record is the sum of
its ID size, vector size (4x vector dimensions), and metadata size.

.


WRITE UNITS

Writes are throttled after 50K WUs per second during the Public Preview period.
Throttling will be lifted and alternate pricing for high write rates will be
introduced soon.



Resources consumed by write operations (Upsert, Update and Delete).


READ UNITS

Reads are throttled after 1K RUs per second during the Public Preview period.
Throttling will be lifted and alternate pricing for high read rates will be
introduced soon.



Resources consumed by read operations (Query and Fetch).


HOW COST SCALES


WRITE COST

Write cost scales linearly by the number of write operations (upsert, update,
delete) within a given index.


QUERY COST

Query cost scales sub-linearly compared to total size of records within an index
or namespace.

For query cost, only pay for the data scanned and not the entire index, meaning
you pay only a fraction of your total record count. Dividing records into or
indexes will reduce the scanned space and cost less.During Public Preview
period, reads are throttled after 1K RUs per second, and writes after 50K WUs
per second. Throttling will be lifted and alternate pricing for high read rates
will be introduced soon.

VECTOR DIMENSIONALITY

This figure is determined by the specific embedding model you have chosen to
produce your vectors. If unsure, you can check your existing index or the model
documentation.

low = 384 dimensions
med = 768 dimensions
high = 1536 dimensions



RECORD COUNT

This is the number of vectors in your initial upload to Pinecone. If you have an
existing pod-based index, you can find this number in the or by calling

During Public Preview, each namespace can hold up to 1 billion records each.
Update namespace count accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


QUERIES PER MONTH

How often will users (or your APIs) read from your Pinecone index?
Reads may be throttled during public preview period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WRITES PER MONTH

How many writes will you make to your Pinecone index each month?
Writes may be throttled during public preview period.


NAMESPACES

This is the number of namespaces (partitions) your Index will have.

A namespace typically corresponds to a single end-user (or tenant) of your
application. Adding additional namespaces can reduce your overall cost.





METADATA SIZE

This is the average size of your metadata measured in bytes.

low = 200 bytes
med = 500 bytes
high = 1000 bytes
