LIMITS



This page summarizes current Pinecone limitations.


GENERAL LIMITATIONS

 * * Max size for an upsert request is 2MB. Recommended upsert limit is 100
     vectors per request.
   
   * Pinecone is eventually consistent, so there can be a slight delay before
     upserted records are available to query.
     
     After upserting records, use the operation to check if the current vector
     count matches the number of records you expect, although this method may
     not work for pod-based indexes with multiple replicas.
   
   * Dense vectors must contain at least one non-zero value.
   
   * Max dimensionality for dense vectors is 20,000.
   
   * Sparse vectors can contain no more than 1000 non-zero values.
   
   * Max dimensionality for sparse vectors is 4.2 billion.
   
   * Records with sparse vector values must also contain dense vector values.
   
   * Only indexes using the support sparse-dense vectors.
     
     Upserting sparse-dense vectors into these index types with a different
     distance metric, or into different index types will succeed, but querying
     will return an error.
   
   * Indexes created before February 22, 2023 do not support sparse vectors.

 * * Max metadata size per vector is 40 KB.
   
   * Null metadata values are not supported. Instead of setting a key to hold a
     null value, we recommend you remove that key from the metadata payload.

 * * Max value for top_k, the number of results to return, is 10,000.

 * and
   
   * Max vectors per fetch or delete request is 1,000.


SERVERLESS INDEX LIMITATIONS


> ⚠️
> 
> WARNING
> 
> Serverless indexes are in public preview and are available only on AWS in the
> us-west-2 region. Test thoroughly before using serverless indexes in
> production.

 * Each project is limited to 20 serverless indexes.

 * Each serverless index is limited to 10,000 namespaces.

 * Each serverless namespace is limited to 1B vectors.

 * During the public preview period, requests are limited as follows:
   
   * query requests are limited to 1000 /second
   
   * upsert, delete, and update requests, combined, are limited to 50,000
     /second
   
   * list, fetch, and describe_index_stats requests, combined, are limited to
     2.5 requests/second

 * Serverless indexes do not support the following features:
   
   * 
   
   * Instead, you can .
   
   * 
   
   * Because serverless indexes scale automantically based on usage, this
     operation is not relevant
   
   * 


POD-BASED INDEX LIMITATIONS

 * Each p1 pod has enough capacity for 1M vectors with 768 dimensions.
   Each s1 pod has enough capacity for 5M vectors with 768 dimensions.

 * Metadata with high cardinality, such as a unique value for every vector in a
   large index, uses more memory than expected and can cause the pods to become
   full.

 * You cannot query or write to a collection after its creation. For this
   reason, a collection only incurs storage costs.
   
   You can only perform operations on collections in the current Pinecone
   project.

 * Only s1 and p1 using the support sparse-dense vectors.


STARTER INDEX LIMITATIONS

 * Organizations on the are limited to one project containing one free .
   
   If you need more than a single starter index, .

 * Starter indexes are limited to 100,000 records.

 * Starter indexes are limited to 100 .
   
   If you need more than 100 namespaces, you may wish to in your project.
   Another alternative is to upgrade to the and use index types that support
   more namespaces.

 * Starter indexes can be hosted only in the gcp-starter environment, which is
   us-central-1 (Iowa) region of the GCP cloud.

 * Starter indexes do not support the following features:
   
   * 
   
   * Collections may not be necessary or appropriate for starter indexes.
     Collections serve two primary purposes: decreasing usage by archiving
     inactive indexes, and experimenting with different index configurations.
     However, starter indexes neither incur usage costs nor specify pod types or
     sizes.
   
   * In some cases, you may be able to instead.
   
   * 
   
   * Because you can have only one starter index, this operation is not
     supported.
