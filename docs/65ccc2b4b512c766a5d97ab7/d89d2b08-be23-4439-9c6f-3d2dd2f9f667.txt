AUTHENTICATION



This guide explains how to authenticate API calls to your Pinecone project.


OVERVIEW

All API calls to your Pinecone index authenticate with an for the project
containing the target index. If you are using a client, like the Python or
Node.js clients, you can initialize a client object, which allows you to provide
your API key in one place and use it multiple times. If you are making HTTP
requests with a tool like cURL, the HTTP request must include a header that
specifies the API key. This topic describes each method.


FINDING YOUR PINECONE API KEY

To find your API key, open the and click API Keys. This view also displays the
for your project.


INITIALIZE A CLIENT

To initialize a client with your API key and environment, use the following
code:

PythonJavaScript
import pinecone

pinecone.init(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", environment="YOUR_ENVIRONMENT")


import { PineconeClient } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';

const pinecone = new PineconeClient();

await pinecone.init({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    environment: "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT",
});


Function calls with this client use the authentication information provided at
initialization. For example:

PythonJavaScript
# Creates an index using the API key and environment stored in the client 'pinecone'.
pinecone.create_index("auth-guide", dimension=8, metric="euclidean")


// Constructs a create index request object.
const createRequest = {
    name: "auth-guide",
    dimension: 8,
    metric:"euclidean",
};

// Creates an index using the API key and environment stored in the client 'pinecone'.
await pinecone.createIndex({ createRequest });



ADD A HEADER TO AN HTTP REQUEST

When issuing an HTTP request to Pinecone, each request must contain an Api-Key
header that specifies an API key. This API key must be valid for a project in
the environment specified in the URL.

curl
curl -i -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  https://controller.YOUR_ENVIRONMENT.pinecone.io/databases \
  -d '{
    "name": "auth-guide",
    "dimension": 8,
    "metric": "euclidean"
  }'
