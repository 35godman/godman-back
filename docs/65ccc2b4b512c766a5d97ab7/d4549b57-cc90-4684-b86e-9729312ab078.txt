CREATE AN INDEX


post https://api.pinecone.io/indexes

This operation deploys a Pinecone index. This is where you specify the measure
of similarity, the dimension of vectors to be stored in the index, which cloud
provider you would like to deploy with, and more.

For guidance and examples, see .

Body Params

The desired configuration for the index.

name
string
required

The name of the index. Resource name must be 1-45 characters long, start and end
with an alphanumeric character, and consist only of lower case alphanumeric
characters or '-'.


dimension
int32
required

The dimensions of the vectors to be inserted in the index.


metric
string

The distance metric to be used for similarity search. You can use 'euclidean',
'cosine', or 'dotproduct'.

Default: cosine

cosineeuclideandotproduct
spec
object
required

The spec object defines how the index should be deployed.

For serverless indexes, you define only the cloud and region where the index
should be hosted. For pod-based indexes, you define the environment where the
index should be hosted, the pod type and size to use, and other index
characteristics.

Serverless indexes are in public preview and are available only on AWS in the
us-west-2 region. Test thoroughly before using serverless indexes in production.
