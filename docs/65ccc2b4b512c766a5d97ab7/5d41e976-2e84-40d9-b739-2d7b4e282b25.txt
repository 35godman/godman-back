DATA SYNC AND SEARCH: PINECONE AND AIRBYTE

By Roie Schwaber-Cohen

Airbyte offers a platform for creating ETL pipelines without writing integration
code. It supports integrations with hundreds of systems, including databases,
data warehouses, and SaaS products. The Pinecone connector for Airbyte allows
users to hook up these systems directly into Pinecone. The connector will take
care of fetching data from the connected source, embed it using OpenAI and
Cohere and then upsert it into Pinecone.

Data integration often requires connecting numerous sources, each with its

data needs. That's where the Pinecone connector comes into the picture.
